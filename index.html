  The minute I heard my love story, I started looking for you not knowing how blind that was.
  <br>
  Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They are in each other all along.
  <br>
  <br>
  You don't need a reason to love, for love is the reason.
  <br>
  You don't meed a season to love, for love is the season.
